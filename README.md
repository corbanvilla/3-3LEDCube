##Step 1
The first step is to make a mold with any old cardboard you have laying around. This will help you layout your leds and keep them aligned as they should be. Just get a pencil, and poke 9 holes in your cardboard as big as your led. They should be a bit less than the length of the smallest leg (of your led) apart. Like so:

##Step 2
Now bend all the short legs (cathodes), and place them in the mold so they're all touching each other, like shown in the picture:
