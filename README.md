##Tools
- Tools Required:
- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Tweezers / Pliers
- Hot Glue Gun

##Step 1
The first step is to make a mold with any old cardboard you have laying around. This will help you layout your leds and keep them aligned as they should be. Just get a pencil, and poke 9 holes in your cardboard as big as your led. They should be a bit less than the length of the smallest leg (of your led) apart. Like so:

##Step 2
Now bend all the short legs (cathodes), and place them in the mold so they're all touching each other, like shown in the picture:

Solder all the legs together but make sure they don't touch the anode (longer leg). If you have tweezers, you can use them to hold the legs together while you solder. They'll make your life much easier! :-)
Do this process 3 times for a total of 3 3x3 led sheets

##Step 3
Place a sheet of leds upside down in the mold, then start soldering the anodes together (the long legs). Sometimes bending the anodes slightly can help when soldering them together. Do this for the final layer so you will have a 3x3x3 led cube.
